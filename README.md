# CMD_blog: A Simple Terminal App for Generating Dynamic Content

## About This Project
CMD_blog is a lightweight terminal-based application designed to generate dynamic content for static websites. If your application doesn't have an admin panel or a content management system, CMD_blog provides a straightforward solution to create and manage content with ease.



## Purpose of This Project
This project is a personal exercise for me as a developer. It serves as a training ground to sharpen my skills in building terminal-based applications and solving real-world problems. 

As I continue to develop CMD_blog, Iâ€™ll explore more features and potentially expand its capabilities based on user feedback.


## Getting Started
To try out CMD_blog, clone the repository and run the app in your terminal. Instructions for setup and usage will be provided in the README file.

`` npm run blog generate <quantity> `` to generate blog

`` npm run start:dev `` to run server

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute or provide feedback as I continue to build out this tool. 

*Happy coding!*
